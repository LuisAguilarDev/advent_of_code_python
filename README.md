Welcome! This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles, written in Python.

## 🚀 Zero-Setup: Just Open in Dev Container

**No installation required!**

Simply open this project in a [Dev Container](https://containers.dev/) (like GitHub Codespaces or VS Code Remote Containers).

You get a **100% safe, isolated environment** with all dependencies pre-installed:

- Python 3 (with pip)
- Git (latest)
- Node.js, npm, and ESLint (for JS/TS needs)
- All tools on the `PATH`

Your local system is never changed. Everything runs inside a disposable, secure container.
